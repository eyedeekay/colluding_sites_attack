<h2>An experimental solution that can exist outside of core i2p</h2>

<p>The obvious answer to this problem is to alter the http proxy to generate a
new destination for every eepsite it visits. But it would add bloat and it's
actually more in-scope for an external application using i2p's SAMv3 API to
generate tunnels on the fly. Which is why I'm building and using(dogfooding)
si-i2p-plugin, who's source code is available on github at
https://github.com/eyedeekay/si-i2p-plugin. It presents an http proxy on port
4443, which generates a new i2p destination for each i2p destination it has to
retrieve. It then routes all requests to that eepSite through that tunnel and
forwards it to the new http proxy, thereby providing some automatic isolation of
contextual identities. Keep in mind, my approach is experimental, which is why
this site exists. I am actively using these sites to test this software. I am
not conducting an attack, at least not on anyone else.</p>

<p>In addition to the http proxy, it provides a file-based management interface
for the tunnels it creates. for more information, see the github repo for now,
and eventually an eepSite which I'll link here when I put it up.</p>
