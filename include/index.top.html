<h1>How Colluding Sites can Identify You</h1>

<p>This is a dangerous web site! In fact, pretty much all web sites are
dangerous in theory. But this one's about the theory, so that makes it even
more dangerous. It's intended to provide more information about already public
information, suggest a change, and not to cause harm or alarm. I don't think
you should use this information to do bad things to i2p users or the i2p
network. Only click on the links on this page if you're curious about the
matter of your i2p client tunnel destinationss. Also, for the record,
<strong>this page </strong> is not recording any headers or logs of any kind,
it's generated and hosted by the code hosted in
https://github.com/eyedeekay/colluding_sites_attack. This is a transparent
service for educational purposes only. </p>

<h2>What does Identification mean in this context</h2>

<p>By "Identification" I mean any characteristic which remains consistent in
spite of what destination you are connected to, in particular, this is the
normal operation of the i2p http proxy included with i2p and i2pd(presumably
kovri as well if it has an http proxy). It's just a fact that in order to
request a resource for retrieval, you have to provide an address to return
that resource to. The http proxy is intended to do this in a very basic way,
you get a destination when i2p starts up, and it's torn down when it shuts down.
But while it's up, the destination stays the same. This is the normal operation
of i2p, it's documented, and it's not because anyone's a bad person. It's
because it's a demonstration of the network's functionality and I don't think
that, necessarily, the i2p core developers need to do anything in the core about
it. But I'll get to that in a second.</p>

<h2>This attack does not, in and of itself, reveal your real IP Address* or
any other marker thought to correspond to a real-life identity or location or
context. Perish the thought.</h2>

<h3>*However, if you viit the sites linked below, a variety of attacks will be
carried out against your browser and your https proxy, one of which can reveal
the IP address of an improperly configured browser and there's nothing the proxy
can do about this. Make sure to always check [*] Use this proxy for all
connections in Firefox. This is the default in surf and uzbl. I don't know about
Chrome or IE. Don't click the links. They are here for me to test my software.<h3>

<p>Because the tunnel is consistent across remote destinations, and because it
has a useful lifespan, it could be used to identify traffic by someone running
a network of colluding eepSites. If someone were using the default http proxy to
use a centralized social network on i2p(Like, a maliciously modified mastodon
instance or something), that could be used to build a profile of that person
across renewed http proxy destinations. Every time you log in to that mastodon
instance, your new http proxy destination becomes linked to the old one. God
forbid if there's ever a facebook.i2p(remember, bypassing censorship and
obfuscating location are valuable even without anonymity). So that's probably
not a big deal right now, if most people on i2p are not participating in those
kinds of social network directly, but it's present. It's pretty boring, it's not
a bug, but it's present. Heck, it was even brought to my attention by someone
else. I just made a demo after I was mostly done fabricating a solution because
I needed to test it.</p>

<h2>Furthermore, it's actually pretty useful to have destination tunnels with
user-controlled lifespans</h2>

<p>In fact, a long-term cryptographic destination is exactly the thing that
allows you to host a hidden service. It's just that, with core i2p and i2pd, you
have to manually separate your contextual identities.</p>
