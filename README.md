# colluding_sites_attack

Set up a network of colluding sites to correlate i2p destinations. Moved from
si-i2p-plugin.

fingeprintjs2 has been added to the system now. Don't use this system for
malicious purposes, and *any practical degradation of privacy of people seeking*
*privacy is inherently malicous*. This is for *testing software for weaknesses*
not for degrading privacy.
